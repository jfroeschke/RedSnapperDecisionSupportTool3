      <p id="first">The recreational harvest of red snapper in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico
          is constrained by an annual quota.  In federal waters, red snapper harvest is limited to a 2-fish bag limit,
           16-inch total length (TL) minimum size limit, and a fishing season that begins on June 1 and closes when the quota is projected to be caught.  
           In recent years, the<a target="_blank" href="http://portal.gulfcouncil.org/redsnapperAp/cpd.html"> <b></b>harvest rate has increased rapidly</b></a>  but
           the <a target="_blank" href="http://portal.gulfcouncil.org/redsnapperAp/redsnapperSeasons.html"> <b></b>recreatioanal season length</b></a> has been drastically shortened to prevent overfishing. </p>  
           <h3  style='text-align:center;'>What can we do?</h3>
           <p id='second'> The Council is considering a 
               <a target="_blank" href="http://gulfcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/Recreational-State-Management-for-Red-Snapper-1-16-2018.pdf"> <b></b>State Management Program</b></a>
               
                to allow individual states to establish seasons and bag limits to provide more flexibility to their anglers.
                This <a target="_blank" href="http://gulfcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/Recreational-State-Management-for-Red-Snapper-1-16-2018.pdf"> <b></b>amendment</b></a>
                 contains two actions.  The first addresses the recreational sector components 
             that a state management program would manage and the second considers methods to allocate the harvest among the Gulf states.</p>
             
             <h3  style='text-align:center;'>What's this app for?</h3>
        <p id='last'>This interactive application focuses on <b>Action 2</b> (Allocation of the Recreational quota among states) 
            and allows you to explore alternatives methods to allocate the recreational quota among the five Gulf states. 
             Allocations are often based on historical landings over a representative time series. 
              You can explore various time series (<b>Alternatives 2 and 3</b>) as well the effect of excluding particular 
              years that may not be appropriate (<b>Alternative 4</b>). 
               <b>Alternative 5</b> uses the ten years of highest landings for each state from 1986 through 2015.   
                <b>Alternative 6</b> considers information about the spatial distribution of red snapper and fishing effort to determine an allocation.
