The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council is considering a State Management Program for red snapper (http://gulfcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/Recreational-State-Management-for-Red-Snapper-1-16-2018.pdf) to allow individual states to establish seasons and bag limits to provide more flexibility to their recreational anglers. The Council will consider the actions for this program during the April 2018 Council meeting.  This amendment (http://gulfcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/Recreational-State-Management-for-Red-Snapper-1-16-2018.pdf) contains two actions. Action 1 addresses the recreational sector components that a state management and Action 2 considers methods to allocate the harvest among the Gulf states.

This report summarizes the management options selected by the decision tool user for Action 2 which identifies a state-based allocation of recreationally harvested red snapper for each state.  The user selected options are described in Table 1.  The allocation (on percent basis) for each selected option is available in Table 2 and Figure 1.  

```{r model, collapse=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
#kable(values$df)
kable(tmpR(),row.names=FALSE, caption="Table 1.  Selected options to calculate allocation of recreationally harvested red snapper among five states adjoining the Gulf of Mexico.")
```

```{r model2, collapse=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
#kable(data.frame(values2$df))
kable(tmpRtest(), digits=2, row.names=FALSE, caption="Table 2. Allocation of recreationally harvested red snapper among five states.  The values selected for each variable is described in Table 1.  Values are reported to two decimal places and may not sum to 100% in all cases.  Actual allocations would rely on more precise values to elminate rounding errors." )
```
